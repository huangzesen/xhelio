In practice, the user draws a box\n               and a horizontal frequency line is selected for the frequencies to be\n               used in that time interval.  Usually, this is used when a cutoff\n               frequency or a peak frequency is weak enough that the bottom/top/peak\n               algorithm has difficulty selecting a feature.\n\n            3. \"manual-diag\" Same as manual, except that the selected frequencies lie\n               along a diagonal of the drawn box.  This works well when there's a steep\n               gradient in frequency but, again, the algorithm has a hard time picking\n               out top/bottom/peak.  \n\n            4. \"peak\"  This is the peak of a narrowband spectral feature.\n\n            5. \"top\" This denoted the top of a feature -- usually one extended in frequency,\n               hence, this is the high-frequency cutoff.\n\n            6. \"relabel\" This is an option that allows the user to re-define a spectral feature,\n              e.g. from fuh to fpe, and is useful when the operator mislabeled the feature to\n              begin with and doesn't want to redo the digitization, or if the user 'guesses'\n              that this must be one characteristic frequency, but after the tool calculates\n              the other frequencies the user realizes a different definition might work better.\n              Alone, it doesn't tell you what visual feature was digitized.",
