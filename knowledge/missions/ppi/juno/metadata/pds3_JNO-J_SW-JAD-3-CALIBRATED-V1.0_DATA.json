These are issues that can be identified within the JADE packet of data itself without any external information. e.g. timing issues due to the MAG time stutter, or any voltage pulsing, would not be included as there are no indicators to them within this JADE packet. [For a more comprehensive list of potential issues from internal and external sources please see the Level 3 data.] Level 2 issues of this JADE packet are flagged by individual bits, and several may be hit.  If no issues are flagged then this 4-byte unsigned integer is zero. A value of 4294967295 is the MISSING_CONSTANT and means that the issue status is currently unknown. All bits at 0 implies all is okay as seen by this packet.  If a bit is set to 1 then that bit is flagged, otherwise it is set to zero and unflagged. The bits are set as followed, grouped in to seriousness: Not very serious issues for doing science: Bit  0 = UTC time is predicted, yet to be finalized. Bit  1 = Position/Orientation values predicted, yet to be finalized.  Level 3 (and above) data only. Bit  2 = TABLES_VERSION object was altered on the ground to accurately reflect a 'commanded parameter update' outside the initial per-orbit commands JADE is returning. [If changed, the original downlinked TABLES_VERSION value can be found by cross- referencing the PARAM_TABLE_VER object in the JAD_L20_HSK_ALL_SHK files.  Note here the PARAM_TABLE_VER value is given as a unsigned integer of Hex Major-Middle-Minor, such that a value of 770 decimal is in hex 0x302, meaning Table Version 3.02 ] Bit  3 = FSW_VERSION 4.00 LRS/CAL Ion Species bug fixed on the ground by adjusting TIMESTAMP_WHOLE, TIMESTAMP_SUB, and ACCUMULATION_TIME based on cross-referencing JADE commanding. Bit  4 = LRS/CAL Ion Species record with unobserved look directions (views) populated using views from neighboring record. See Bit 12 for uncorrected/unpopulated description. (Only possible if ACCUMULATION_TIME = 30.) Bit  5 = TIMESTAMP_WHOLE/SUB adjusted on the ground to mitigate any Juno time stutter affects. [Other TIMESTAMPs are susceptible to the onboard time stutter too, but only the JADE packet TIMESTAMP_WHOLE/SUB is tracked here.] Bit  6 =       Currently unused. Bit  7 = Warning, a leap second occurs during the accumulation period. Data slightly different than expected, but can be used for science with a little extra coding: Bit  8 = ACCUM_TRUNCATION object flagged. Bit  9 = Electron (HRS/LRS/CAL) MAG objects are not tracked, are either zeros or MISSING_CONSTANT. [LRS and CAL did not have MAG objects prior to FSW_VERSION 4.10, therefore those MAG objects here are set to MISSING_CONSTANT when FSW_VERSION < 4.10.] Bit 10 = TIMESTAMP_WHOLE/SUB affected by a Juno onboard time stutter, JADE reported timestamp is likely 1 whole tick too large. [Other TIMESTAMPs are susceptible to the onboard time stutter too, but only the JADE packet TIMESTAMP_WHOLE/SUB is tracked here.] Bit 11 =       Currently unused. Bit 12 = LRS/CAL Ion Species record potentially has unobserved look directions (spin phase sectors or views) present in the data, meaning the record may not contain data for a full 4pi steradians field-of-view. Unobserved look directions have zero counts per view (or counts per second) in the data, although an observed look direction may also have zero counts if no ions were measured. Therefore there is a potential confusion over zero measured counts or simply unmeasured. e.g. if the spin period is 30.7 seconds, then not all of the 78 spin phase sectors will be sampled in 30 seconds. (Unobserved views are only possible if ACCUMULATION_TIME <= 30.) See the JADE SIS for more information. Bit 13 = At least one anode is blanked. See SIS document for further information. Bit 14 = FSW_VERSION 4.00 LRS/CAL Ion Species bug warning: Not fixed as yet - when fixed it will become bit 3 of ISSUES instead. Level 2 data only when FSW_VERSION = 4.00, ACCUMULTION_TIME object is MISSING_CONSTANT. Also, TIMESTAMP_WHOLE:TIMESTAMP_SUB is the end of the packet rather than the usual start, see TIMESTAMP_WHOLE object for more details. [Only affects data from 2015-089 to 2015-115.] Bit 15 = Electron Anodes Reversed. Level 2 data only when FSW_VERSION < 4.10 and only electron packets. Electron anodes are reversed in order and need to be remapped, however electron Spin Phase data (LRS data) cannot be remapped. See the SIS document for more information about this. [Affects all electron data 2011 to 2015-115.] Data very different than expected, may not be suitable for science - use with extreme caution. Bit 16 = Data is not from flight instrument on Juno, see FLIGHT_OR_STL object. Bit 17 = MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED object flagged. Electron HRS/CAL/HVE packets use all three electron sensors and therefore have three MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED values per packet. Setting this flag means at least one of those three mcps is not at its commanded value. Bit 18 = Data includes some JADE-E300 sensor data. (Only flagged for HRS, LRS, CAL and HVE data.) E300 has a high voltage power supply issue and reported energy steps may be incorrect. If E300 is off but still reported in the data product, it may be zeros of fill values. Bit 19 = Ion packet abruptly truncated. This packet should not be used.  It had an ACCUMULATION_TIME = 1, ACCUM_TRUNCATION = 1 and the DATA object is all zeros, with a timestamp that matches an earlier valid packet that was not truncated and has non-zero DATA. e.g. TOF and LOG example in level 2 data at TIMESTAMP_WHOLE of 495879710 (UTC 2015-261). Bit 20 = MCP Dipping Triggered, in one or more sensors. If the sensor measures excessive counts, it temporarily lowers the MCP voltage to reduce the number of counts and protect the sensor. The MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED object is also flagged (Bit 17 in ISSUES) since the MCP is no longer at the commanded voltage. For HRS/CAL/HVE electrons (datasets where multiple sensors are on) it is possible that one sensor has been dipped, but the others are not and still providing good data. (First MCP dip was HRS electrons, 2017-350.) Bit 21 = MCP Dipped sensor's DATA set to fill values. If MCP dipping has triggered (Bit 20 of ISSUES) then:  DATA and BACKGROUND objects (and their *_SIGMAs) have been replaced with MISSING_CONSTANT values. (Never used for Level 2 data, which has the counts as measured in the dipped state.) In addition, Bit 17 of the ISSUES object (i.e. MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED object = 1) is set to zero, and, if it exists, the MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED object itself is changed (from 1) to be 0 for the offending sensor(s). If the DATA object contains data from multiple sensors (HRS/CAL/HVE electrons) then only the elements of the DATA object for the dipped sensor are set to MISSING_CONSTANT (as identified by the MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED value for each sensor (prior to setting them to 0)). [See Bit 22 for a similar flag.] Bit 22 = 1 or more ELC sensor DATA set to fill values. Affects only electron HRS/CAL/HVE products (i.e. products that use multiple sensors), and generally only when starting that mode. When switching to HRS/CAL/HVE from LRS, one JADE-E sensor is already on, and the other(s) have to turn on, then it takes some time for that sensor to reach the commanded voltage. For a given record, MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED = 0 for one sensor but is still = 1 for others. That is one sensor is taking valid science but the other(s) are not there yet and for those sensors:  DATA and BACKGROUND objects (and their *_SIGMAs) have been replaced with MISSING_CONSTANT values. (Never used for Level 2 data, which has the counts as measured in the dipped state.) In addition, Bit 17 of the ISSUES object (i.e. MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED object = 1) is set to zero, and, if it exists, the MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED object itself is changed (from 1) to be 0 for the offending sensor(s). Only the elements of the DATA object for the original MCP_NOT_AT_COMMANDED = 1 sensor(s) (prior to setting them to 0) are set to MISSING_CONSTANT. [Bits 21 and 22 are essentially the same feature caused by an mcp voltage not being at the commanded value, but the reason why this is the case is different.  The treatment is identical for both Bit 21 and Bit 22.] Bit 23 =       Currently unused. Bit 24 =       Currently unused. Bit 25 =       Currently unused. Bit 26 =       Currently unused. Bit 27 =       Currently unused. Bit 28 =       Currently unused. Bit 29 =       Currently unused. Bit 30 =       Currently unused. Bit 31 = Reserved for MISSING_CONSTANT use. Each bit has a decimal value of 2^{bit number}, and the Issues flag is the sum of 2^{flagged bit numbers}. For instance, if this ISSUES flag = 131329, then in binary that value is 00000000000000100000000100000001 showing bits 17, 8 and 0 are flagged. [If a currently unused bit is set, please check the latest LBL file for this product that you can find to see if it now has a definition.]",
