These values represent the average intensities over the sampling interval. F is a vector containing the average signal for the 76 frequencies of the low and high bands. Elements 0 through 63 are from the low band receiver and correspond to frequencies of 1.25+0.75*N KHz where N is the element number (0..63). The frequency channels from 64 to 75 correspond to the following frequencies: F(64):  52 KHz F(65):  63 KHz F(66):  71 KHz F(67):  100 KHz F(68):  120 KHz F(69):  148 KHz F(70):  196 KHz F(71):  272 KHz F(72):  387 KHz F(73):  540 KHz F(74):  740 KHz F(75):  940 KHz",
