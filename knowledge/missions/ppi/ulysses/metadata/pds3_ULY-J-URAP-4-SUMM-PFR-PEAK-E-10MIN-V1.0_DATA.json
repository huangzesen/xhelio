This value should not occur as fixed frequency data is removed from the UDS data. 4: The mode switched from fast to slow or slow to fast during the averaging interval. 5: Unknown mode.  This value occurs if there was no valid data during the averaging interval.  This could be due to a data gap or bad data.  Data acquired while the PFR is in fixed tune mode is ignored so this value for the MODE will also occur if the PFR was in fixed tune mode during the entire averaging interval.",
